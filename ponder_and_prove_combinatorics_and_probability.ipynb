There are about 1044 molecules of air and about 2 x 1022 molecules in each breath a person takes. That gives a 2 x 1022/1044 chance that one molecule we breath in came from Cezar’s last breath. To determine the probability of multiple things happening you multiply the probabilities. (1-2x10-22)(2x10^22). e = 2.718…. we then re write it as (e(-2x10^(-22)))(2x10^(22)) which equals 4e + 44 which is 1/2.72x4 = 1/ 54.73 = .018 which means there is a 1.8% chance that none of the molecules that are in our lungs came from Caesar’s last breath.
